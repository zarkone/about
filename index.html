            After finishing liceum with a hard humanitarian bias(English,
            Literature) in 2006 I've started my carreer as a young freelance
            web-designer. I had deicided to interupt humanitarian line and enter to the
            techical university on speciality "Software Engineering". Since that
            time i've tried myself in a lot of industries of software to
            satisfy my knowledge starve.

            All this time I
            was making websites and  after year or two I've noticed that most of
            the time and power i spend on thinking how to make  look and
            feel of the website better (even if this is not required by
            client). That is the thing which attract me in website design in 2006,
            and this is why i always wanted to create websites.

          After army (I was an paratrooper, mechanic and driver of battle troop tanks) I've
          restored at the university and began to spend all my free time
          improving my Javascript skills. Now I'm at last course of education, and my final
          work deeply connected both to frontend development and to client
          and server Javascript tech stack.

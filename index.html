In 2006 I left the Altai State Pedagogical Lyceum where I'd been majoring in English and Literature. Following that I decided to start my career as a freelance Web-Designer and enrolled in the bachelor program 'Software Engineering' in Altai State Technical University. Since then I've narrowed into an array of different fields and technologies of software development. Moreover I was continually putting my new knowledge into practice as I was designing websites and tried to be proactive in making them both good-looking and user-friendly. This is exactly what exctites and satisfies me. 
Following that I joined the army where I served as a paratrooper and a tank driver for one year. Upon discharge, I rejoined the university and started learning Javascript. 
Currently I'm writing the bachelor thesis in my final year, which is essentially hinged on both frontend development and client and server Javascript tech stack.
